# Quick Fix for Git Merge Conflict

You have local changes on EC2 that are blocking the git pull. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Stash Local Changes and Pull (Recommended)

Run these commands on EC2:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/weapons
git stash
git pull
```

This temporarily saves your local changes and pulls the latest code.

## Option 2: Discard Local Changes and Pull

If you don't need the local changes:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/weapons
git reset --hard HEAD
git pull
```

This discards your local changes completely.

## Option 3: View What Changed Locally First

To see what you changed locally:

```bash
git diff complete-ssl-setup.sh
```

Then decide whether to keep or discard the changes.

## After Successful Pull:

Once `git pull` succeeds, continue with the testing steps:

```bash
chmod +x complete-ssl-setup.sh quick-deploy.sh init-letsencrypt.sh
./complete-ssl-setup.sh myweapons.duckdns.org Beshoy.Soliman.FCI21114@sadatacademy.edu.eg
```

---

**Recommended command sequence:**

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/weapons
git stash
git pull
chmod +x complete-ssl-setup.sh quick-deploy.sh init-letsencrypt.sh
./complete-ssl-setup.sh myweapons.duckdns.org Beshoy.Soliman.FCI21114@sadatacademy.edu.eg
```

This will fix the merge conflict and run the SSL setup! ðŸš€
