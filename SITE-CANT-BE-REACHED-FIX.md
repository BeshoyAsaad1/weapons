# "Site Can't Be Reached" - Troubleshooting Guide

## üî¥ Error: "This site can't be reached"

This means one of the following:

1. ‚ùå SSL setup hasn't been completed on EC2 yet
2. ‚ùå Docker containers aren't running
3. ‚ùå DuckDNS isn't pointing to the correct IP
4. ‚ùå EC2 Security Group ports aren't open

## üîç Let's Diagnose the Issue

### On Your EC2 Instance, Run These Commands:

```bash
# 1. Check if you're in the right directory
cd /home/ubuntu/weapons
pwd

# 2. Check if containers are running
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps

# 3. Check if nginx is listening on port 443
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep -E '80|443'

# 4. Test if DNS is working
nslookup myweapons.duckdns.org

# 5. Check if you can reach the server locally
curl -I http://localhost:80
```

## üö® Quick Diagnosis by Output:

### If `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps` shows no containers:
**Problem**: Containers aren't running
**Solution**: Run the SSL setup script

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/weapons
git stash
git pull
chmod +x complete-ssl-setup.sh quick-deploy.sh init-letsencrypt.sh
./complete-ssl-setup.sh myweapons.duckdns.org Beshoy.Soliman.FCI21114@sadatacademy.edu.eg
```

### If `nslookup myweapons.duckdns.org` doesn't return `3.74.228.219`:
**Problem**: DNS not configured correctly
**Solution**: 
1. Go to [duckdns.org](https://www.duckdns.org)
2. Login
3. Make sure your domain points to `3.74.228.219`
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for DNS propagation

### If `netstat` shows nothing on port 80/443:
**Problem**: Nginx isn't running
**Solution**: Start the containers

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
```

## ‚úÖ Complete Fix - Run ALL These Commands:

**Copy and paste this entire block into your EC2 terminal:**

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /home/ubuntu/weapons

# Fix git conflict and pull latest code
git stash
git pull

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x complete-ssl-setup.sh quick-deploy.sh init-letsencrypt.sh

# Verify DuckDNS is pointing to your EC2 IP
echo "Checking DNS..."
nslookup myweapons.duckdns.org

# If DNS looks good, run the SSL setup
./complete-ssl-setup.sh myweapons.duckdns.org Beshoy.Soliman.FCI21114@sadatacademy.edu.eg

# Check if containers started successfully
echo ""
echo "Checking container status..."
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps

# Check if ports are listening
echo ""
echo "Checking if nginx is listening..."
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep -E '80|443'

# Test local connection
echo ""
echo "Testing local connection..."
curl -I http://localhost:80
```

## üéØ Expected Successful Output:

After running the commands above, you should see:

```
‚úÖ DNS Resolution:
Address: 3.74.228.219

‚úÖ Containers Running:
weaponbackend_web_prod     (healthy)
weaponbackend_nginx_prod   (running)
weaponbackend_redis_prod   (healthy)
weaponbackend_certbot      (running)

‚úÖ Ports Listening:
tcp6  0  0  :::80   :::*  LISTEN
tcp6  0  0  :::443  :::*  LISTEN

‚úÖ HTTP Response:
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
```

## üåê After Successful Setup:

1. Wait 30 seconds for services to fully start
2. Open browser
3. Visit: `https://myweapons.duckdns.org/admin/`
4. Should see: Green padlock + Django admin page

## üÜò Still Not Working?

### Check EC2 Security Group:

Your EC2 Security Group MUST have these inbound rules:

| Type  | Protocol | Port Range | Source    |
|-------|----------|------------|-----------|
| HTTP  | TCP      | 80         | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| HTTPS | TCP      | 443        | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| SSH   | TCP      | 22         | Your IP   |

To check/add these rules:
1. Go to AWS Console ‚Üí EC2 ‚Üí Security Groups
2. Find your instance's security group
3. Check Inbound Rules
4. Add missing rules if needed

### Check DuckDNS Configuration:

1. Visit [duckdns.org](https://www.duckdns.org)
2. Login
3. Your domain should show: `myweapons` ‚Üí IP: `3.74.228.219`
4. Click "update ip" button to refresh

### Verify Your EC2 Public IP:

```bash
# On EC2, run:
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4
```

Should return: `3.74.228.219`

If different, update DuckDNS with the new IP!

## üìû Quick Test from Your Local Machine:

From your Windows machine, test if the EC2 server is reachable:

```bash
# Test HTTP (should work even before SSL setup)
curl -I http://3.74.228.219

# Test DNS resolution
nslookup myweapons.duckdns.org
```

If these work, the problem is with the SSL setup. If they don't work, it's a Security Group or EC2 issue.

## üé¨ Next Steps:

1. **Run the complete fix commands** from the "Complete Fix" section above
2. **Post the output here** so I can see what's happening
3. **Try accessing** `https://myweapons.duckdns.org/admin/` again

The most likely issue is that you haven't run the SSL setup script yet. Once you run it, everything should work! üöÄ
